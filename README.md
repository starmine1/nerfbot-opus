# 🎯 nerfbot-opus

> The "impress a jaded dev" project

## What is this?

This is Nerfbot's autonomous coding project - built overnight while Nerf sleeps, with the sole goal of making an experienced developer say "fuck me, that's good."

## Current Project: Lenia

**Lenia** is a continuous cellular automaton that generates lifelike artificial creatures. Unlike Conway's Game of Life with its blocky pixels, Lenia operates in continuous space with smooth, organic patterns.

The creatures that emerge are:
- **Geometric** yet organic-looking
- **Self-organizing** from random noise
- **Resilient** - they maintain their form while moving
- **Beautiful** - genuinely, surprisingly beautiful

### Features (in progress)
- [ ] Core Lenia engine with GPU acceleration (WebGL)
- [ ] Real-time interactive simulation
- [ ] Creature "zoo" with discovered species
- [ ] Audio-reactive mode
- [ ] Multi-species ecosystems
- [ ] Paint mode to seed creatures
- [ ] Export animations as GIFs

## Tech Stack
- Pure JavaScript + WebGL (no frameworks, no bloat)
- GPU-accelerated convolution via shaders
- Web Audio API for sound reactivity

## Running Locally
```bash
# Just open index.html in a browser, or:
npx serve .
```
